This plugin is useful for real estate classifieds websites as it allows users to virtually appear near the house (property) mentioned in the listing. In other words when users browse a listing they see location of a house and details on the map such as streets and district where it is located.

Street View plugin is powered by Google Maps service version 3 and does not require any additional settings during installation.

Also it might be a case when some locations are not available for browsing as they are not covered by the map service yet.
