Remote Adverts plugin allows you and your dealers to display listings basing on criteria, like listings of one dealer or listings of some category on any website using simple and compact JavaScript code.

How it works. In the manager of the plugin you select criteria of listing' displaying, for example 20 listings (5 listings per page) with BMW category. After that plugin gives you a JavaScript code that you place into HTML code of a remote website. In the result the listings from your wensite will be displayed on that remote website.

The manager of the generation has multiple settings of the block that you can use for adjusting style of the block to the website's style where the ad will be displayed. The same can be done by users who are allowed to use this service. You may allow or disallow to use this service by users through the Account Type manager in your admin panel.

Also you may add this service into plans and charge your users for displaying their listings in the remote blocks on other websites.
