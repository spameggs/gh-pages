Flynax Search by Distance plugin allows your users to search listings by distance in any country. This plugin search listings by any country and their zip codes. The plugin also can automatically detects close listings around users according to their location.

The plugin is developed and based on Google Maps API, thus the power of Google Maps allows you provide the up-to-date information on location. New Search by Distance plugin has a transparent circle that shows the active area on location, so users can see the covered area.

NOTE! I have modified this plugin. All request to flynax license- and geoip server were removed!
The plugin now requires an free account at geonames.org!
The geonames.org account username must be entered in the configuration.
Without geonames.org account this plugin does not work.
