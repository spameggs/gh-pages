Compare listings plugin for Flynax classifieds scripts adds an additional functionality to your classifieds website and allows users may compare listings.

Users will find a link “View Comparison Table” in the frontend of your Flynax classifieds web site which will help them to compare different products. In that comparison table they may see different listings with products and compare them. It’s a useful plugin for your users because when they compare listings they define the best listing with a product which they are looking for and give a chance to make the right decision to buy it or not.

Let your users compare listings at your Flynax classifieds web site.
