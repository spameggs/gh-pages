Flynax Coupon Code plugin allows creating coupon codes with a discount or making a purchase of a plan or a package with plans at no cost.

There is a special manager in the administration interface that can help you to create different types of coupon codes. For example you may create coupon codes with a discount in percentage or make a discount for a particular amount. Such coupon codes can be assigned to a type of users or a particular user account. The time frame of coupon codes validity is adjustable and can be limited.

Created coupon codes with discounts can be placed at your partners' websites or used in mass mailing to attract more visitors to your site.
