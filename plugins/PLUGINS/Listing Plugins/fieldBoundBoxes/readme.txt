This Flynax 4 plugin is designed for a creation of frontend blocks with filters of listings by fields. For instance if you use Flynax Auto Classifieds Script and you need a block with a list of car body styles (already exist in the version) then you can easily create a new block and select it as the "field filter" and the field as "Body Style". After that the plugin Field-bound Boxes will create a new block and parcel all body styles in the way of links. The links of the block will direct to pages where are listings displayed in corresponding body style.
