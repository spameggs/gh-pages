Listings Carousel plugin offers so called carousel effect that maybe applied to featured listings blocks and those blocks that are created by Listing Box plugin. Thus you may easily make any static block with listings into carousel.
While adding this carousel effect to the blocks with listings you have a number of settings to choose such as speed and direction of scrolling, number of visible listings, number of listings per one scroll and etc.

The new version of the plugin has several innovations like:
- Auto-lopped scrolling, when carousel is not coming back to the start point and the carousel goes nonstop and scrolls listings from the beginning.
- Saves server resources and efficiency, when listings of the next slide scroll are not loaded until the moment they will be needed.
