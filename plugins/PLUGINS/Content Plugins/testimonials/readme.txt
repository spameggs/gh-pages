Testimonials Plugin is a simple and clear manager of testimonials that creates a well designed box with randomly selected testimonials, buttons "Add testimonials" and "Read all" on the frontend of your classifieds website. These two buttons lead to a page with testimonials of your website where site users may read them or add new.

Added testimonials appear in the administration interface and an administrator has to approve them after it they will be displayed on the page with testimonials. Also the administrator may switch off the moderation option, after it all testimonials will be published automatically. We do not recommend switching off this option for your classifieds website in order to prevent unwanted content on your website.

The submit form for adding testimonials is protected against bots with a standard Captcha or you may replace it by reCaptcha if you install Google reCaptcha plugin.

Get more testimonials and gladden your site users.
