This Flynax plugin replaces the default captcha with Google reCaptcha that protects your classifieds website from any kind of spam and bot registrations much better.

reCaptcha is a picture with protective code that should be read by users and entered during the registration and other requests at your classifieds website. reCaptcha uses two words with color inverting or photo with words and digits. This makes the identification of the secret code impossible for bots.

reCaptcha has 4 color themes and can be suited for any design of classifieds websites.

We would not recommend the use of this plugin for websites that do not have problems with spam due to the fact when users can hardly read the words from pics.

This plugin requires installation of the cURL module (this is a part of the server requirements for Flynax software).
