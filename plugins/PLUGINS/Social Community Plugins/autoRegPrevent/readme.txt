Auto Sign Up Prevention Plugin

Flynax plugin - Auto Sign Up Prevention can help you to detect and stop spam at your classifieds website. It is a useful plugin which can help prevent registration of undesirable accounts thus makes your classifieds website clean from spam.
Auto Sign Up Prevention plugin checks registering user with the help of a spam detection service www.stopforumspam.com

It works in the following way: During a registration process the plugin makes a request to the stop spam service with details of a registering user and checks his email, username and IP against the records in the service. If the user's details match the records in the database of the stop spam service then the plugin blocks this user and adds it to the database and displays a message with an error. If a user was added to the black list by mistake the administrator of a classifieds website can unblock him from the administration interface.
